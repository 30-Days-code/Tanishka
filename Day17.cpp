/*Write a program in C++ using exception handling 
in which you have to ask the user to enter the 
marks of a Student for subjects like English,
Chemistry, ADS, and Maths. If the user exceeds
the range of marks (if below 0 or above 100) in 
a particular subject, the program should throw 
an error “Invalid Marks” to the user and repeat
the above processes until the use enters the correct
marks. [NOTE : Try to use try{} block, catch{} block,
throw() function (all of them, if possible) in your program]*/
