/*Write a program in C++ using goto statements 
that calculates the occupancy rate for a 
hotel in which the program will ask the user, 
how many floors the hotel has, and then the 
number of rooms on each floor and how many 
of them are occupied on that floor.

After that, the program should display the
total number of rooms the hotel has, the total
number of rooms that are occupied, the total 
number of rooms that are unoccupied, and the 
percentage of the total rooms that are occupied.

NOTE :-

1. It is a tradition that most hotels do not
have a thirteenth floor so the program should 
skip the entire thirteenth floor.

2. Do not accept a value less than 1 for the 
number of floors. Do not accept a number less
than 5 for the number of rooms on a floor.*/
